# CrystalMod
## Description
Mod to add crystal based planet to factorio.

In the Documentation folder you can find the creation of the base resources.
The main goal of the planet is to use energy management and to facilitate quality by adding machines that guarantee quality items instead of leaving it up to chance.

## Energy and Resources

There are 2 main resources, Ice and Crystal Ore. Ice can be found as patches around the planet.
Crystal Ore is found as patches spawned by killed enemies.

For Crystal Ore, you will be able to mine them and crystalise them into crystals.
These crystals are your power source and your way to create oil and ore products.
However, whenever you create ores or oils, the crystal needs to release it's power.
The energizer works as a battery that needs to release its energy to be able to work.
So the main goal of this planet is to spend your energy.

Spending energy can be done in 2 ways: allowing enemies to seep from the power grids or using it to create quality items.

## Quality
The main unlock of this planet is a machine that can create guaranteed quality items according to the quality distribution in exchange for tons of energy.
A 1000 items become 90 uncommon, 9 rare and 1 epic. 
The buildings that are created will also require crystals of a certain quality to be able to be created.

## Enemies
Enemies spawn resources that can be mined when killed.
There are only small enemies that spawn. They have no intention to 
destroy your base, they try to attach to your power poles and extract energy from your base.
Other enemies will try to attach to attached enemies to create some sort of network.
The enemies will use energy to evolve to larger and more sturdy enemies.
The larger they become, the more rich the ore patch gets when they are killed.
The bigger enemies will also try to defend the network they are building so it becomes harder for you to destroy them.
If you kill the biggest enemy, the ore patch they spawn will contain quality crystal ore.

It is still a debate whether shutting of the power will kill enemies or not.
## Goal
The main goal is to balance energy for quality and energy for feeding enemies to have access to ores.
